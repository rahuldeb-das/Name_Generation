# Name_Generation
A list of dinosaur names is provided in a dataset. The objective is to create new dinosaur names based on the dinosaur names provided in the dataset. To  achieve this a character level language model has been built. The model will understand the patterns of dinosaur names from the dataset and randomly generate new names.
